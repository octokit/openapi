          title: ðŸ¤–ðŸ“¯ GitHub OpenAPI Update
          body: >
            I found new changes in [GitHub's official OpenAPI
            specifications](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description) and
            thought I'd let you know about it ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤–


            I can't tell if the changes include fixes, features, breaking
            changes or just cache updates, you'll have to figure that out on
            yourself and adapt the commit messages accordingly to trigger the
            right release, see [our commit message
            conventions](https://github.com/octokit/openapi/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#merging-the-pull-request--releasing-a-new-version).
