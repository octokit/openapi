# How to contribute

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

We appreciate you taking the time to contribute to `@octokit/openapi`. Especially as a new contributor, you have a valuable perspective that we lost a long time ago: you will find things confusing and run into problems that no longer occur to us. Please share them with us, so we can make the experience for future contributors the best it could be.

Thank you ðŸ’–

## How it all works

I've recorded a video where I work through an update coming from GitHub's official OpenAPI spec.

## Setup the repository locally

First, fork the repository.

Setup the repository locally. Replace `<your account name>` with the name of the account you forked to.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your account name>/openapi.git
cd openapi
npm install
```

### Download the latest official OpenAPI specifications from GitHub

```shell
npm run download
```

### Generate the schemas with the `x-octokit` extension

This command relies on a tool called annica. [`anicca`](https://github.com/xuorig/anicca) is created by Marc-AndrÃ© aka [@xuorig](https://github.com/xuorig), who is working on GitHub's OpenAPI spec and the surrounding tooling. It was needed an OpenAPI diff tool and all the tools found couldn't handle the size of GitHub's spec, which is why [@xuorig](https://github.com/xuorig) created `anicca` in the first place.

It's written in Rust and there is no pre-compiled binary yet that could just run. Once there is the whole setup will become simpler. Until then, the user needs to:

1. Clone [anicca's repository](https://github.com/xuorig/anicca) repository
2. [Install Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) (if it's not installed yet)
3. Define `ANICCA_REPOSITORY_PATH` environment variable pointing to the path where you cloned anicca's repository.

```shell
ANICCA_REPOSITORY_PATH='<path_to_my_local_anicca_repo>' npm run build
```

## Submitting the Pull Request

- Create a new branch locally.
- Make your changes in that branch and push them to your fork
- Submit a pull request from your topic branch to the main branch on the `octokit/openapi` repository.
- Be sure to tag any issues your pull request is taking care of / contributing to. Adding "Closes #123" to a pull request description will automatically close the issue once the pull request is merged in.

## Testing a pull request from github repo locally:

You can install `@octokit/openapi` from each pull request. Replace `[PULL REQUEST NUMBER]`:

```
npm install https://github.pika.dev/octokit/openapi/pr/[PULL REQUEST NUMBER]
```

Once you are done testing, you can revert back to the default module `@octokit/openapi` from npm with `npm install @octokit/openapi`

## Maintainers only

### Merging the Pull Request & releasing a new version

Releases are automated using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).
The following commit message conventions determine which version is released:

1. `fix: ...` or `fix(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps fix version, e.g. `1.2.3` â†’ `1.2.4`
2. `feat: ...` or `feat(scope name): ...` prefix in subject: bumps feature version, e.g. `1.2.3` â†’ `1.3.0`
3. `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body: bumps breaking version, e.g. `1.2.3` â†’ `2.0.0`

Only one version number is bumped at a time, the highest version change trumps the others.
Besides publishing a new version to npm, semantic-release also creates a git tag and release
on GitHub, generates changelogs from the commit messages and puts them into the release notes.

If the pull request looks good but does not follow the commit conventions, use the <kbd>Squash & merge</kbd> button.
