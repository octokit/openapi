Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.\n\nTo return only the SHA-1 hash of the commit reference, you can provide the `sha` custom [media type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.19/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) in the `Accept` header.

For more information, see \"[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.18/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)\".\n\nThe value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub Enterprise Server has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.\n\nThe value of the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on the state of the pull request. Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit. After merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute changes depending on how you merged the pull request:\n\n*   If merged as a [merge commit](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.\n*   If merged via a [squash](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#squashing-your-merge-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the squashed commit on the base branch.\n*   If [rebased](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.\n\nPass the appropriate [media type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.18/rest/overview/media-types/#commits-commit-comparison-and-pull-requests) to fetch diff and patch formats."

If you do not set a public email address for `email`, then it will have a value of `null`. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.18/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication).\n\nThe Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly.

The `:ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/<branch name>` for branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with `:ref`, they will be returned as an array.\n\nWhen you use this endpoint without providing a `:ref`, it will return an array of all the references from your Git database, including notes and stashes if they exist on the server. Anything in the namespace is returned, not just `heads` and `tags`.\n\n**Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.19/rest/reference/pulls#get-a-pull-request) to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull requests. For more information, see \"[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.19/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)\".\n\nIf you request matching references for a branch named `feature` but the branch `feature` doesn't exist, the response can still include other matching head refs that start with the word `feature`, such as `featureA` and `featureB`.",
