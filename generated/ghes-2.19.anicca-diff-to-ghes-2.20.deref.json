The GitHub App must be authenticated as a user. See \"[Identifying and authorizing users for GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.19/apps/building-github-apps/identifying-and-authorizing-users-for-github-apps/)\" for details about authentication. For an example response, see 'Response with GitHub Enterprise Server plan information' below\"\n\nThe `email` key in the following response is the publicly visible email address from your GitHub Enterprise Server [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile). When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email address to be “public” which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for `email`, then it will have a value of `null`. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.19/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#authentication).\n\nThe Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly. For more information, see \"[Emails API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.19/rest/reference/users#emails)\"."
