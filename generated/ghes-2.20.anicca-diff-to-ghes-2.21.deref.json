The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n[homepage]: http://contributor-covenant.org\n[version]: http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/\n",

You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App to run when the `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see \"[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@2.21/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch).\"\n\nThe `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to debug your workflow.\n\nThis endpoint requires write access to the repository by providing either:\n\n  - Personal access tokens with `repo` scope. For more information, see \"[Creating a personal access token for the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)\" in the GitHub Help documentation.\n  - GitHub Apps with both `metadata:read` and `contents:read&write` permissions.\n\nThis input example shows how you can use the `client_payload` as a test to debug your workflow.",
